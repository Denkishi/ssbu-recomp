<!-- Online play: how to turn it on and connect. -->
# Play online (experimental)

This is the game's own Local Wireless mode, played over a network. You only open the game and use Local Wireless -> Create Room / Rooms List. No extra program is needed.

1. Host: open "Local Wireless" and create a room.
2. Guest: open "Local Wireless", find the room in the Rooms List, and join.
3. Host: when the join request appears ("wants to join!"), accept it.
4. Both players vote on a stage and pick their fighters.
5. The host starts the match with L+R.

Smash (versus) always stays a local fight (friends, CPUs), with rollback on or off.
The game's own Online menu (Quickplay, Battle Arenas) on our servers is in progress.

Online play is experimental and ON by default: the game joins the project's public lobby
(`opensmash-lobby.duckdns.org:39500`) when it starts. To turn it off: F1 -> Experimental -> Online play: OFF
(or `online_mode = off` in `config\graphics.ini`).

**Your name:** F1 -> Experimental -> **Your name** (keyboard, or "Type with the controller"). It is the name the
game and the other players see (`player_name` in `config\graphics.ini`); empty = your Windows user name.
Used from the next start.

## The easy way: the F1 menu

Press **F1** (or the controller's Home button) -> **Experimental**. Online play is already ON; you can pick another mode:
**Lobby server** (recommended: the project's public lobby, `opensmash-lobby.duckdns.org:39500`, already filled in),
**Same network (LAN)**, **Host a room** (shows a ROOM CODE with a Copy button) or **Join with a code**.
Press **Restart the game now**, then use the game's own Local Wireless: Create Room / Rooms List.

The rest of this page is the same by hand (environment variables or graphics.ini keys).

## Turn it on

There are four ways to connect. Pick one and set it in one of two places:

- Environment variable `SSBU_ONLINE=...`
- A key in `config\graphics.ini`

Environment variables are read first. The graphics.ini keys are used when no variable is set.

### 1. Same network (LAN), no server

- `SSBU_ONLINE=lan`, or `online_mode = lan`.
- Rooms are found automatically. One of the games acts as the lobby.
- Uses UDP port 39501 (beacon) plus a random UDP port.

### 2. Internet without a server (host and join)

Host:

- `SSBU_ONLINE=host` or `SSBU_ONLINE=host:<port>`, or `online_mode = host`.
- The default port is UDP 39500 (`online_port` changes it).
- The log shows `ROOM CODE XXXXX-XXXXX`. Send this code to the other player.

Joiner:

- `SSBU_ONLINE=join:<code>`, or `online_mode = join` and `online_join = <code>`.

The host's router must let the port in:

- UPnP is tried automatically. Set `online_upnp = off` to disable it.
- Otherwise, forward UDP port 39500 to the host PC.
- If it still fails, the joiner's log prints "your code". The host puts that code in `online_peer`, and both restart. Both sides then open their NAT at the same time.
- If nothing works, use a lobby server (way 3).

### 3. Lobby server

- `SSBU_ONLINE=<host:port>`, or `online_server = <host:port>`.
- Players connect directly by UDP hole punching. If that fails, the lobby relays the traffic.
- `online_direct = off` (or `SSBU_ONLINE_DIRECT=0`): relay only. The lobby does not give anyone your address.

To run the lobby you need Python 3.8 or newer. It uses the standard library only, so there is nothing to install.

```
python tools/net/ssbu_lobby.py --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 39500 [--verbose]
```

- Open UDP port 39500 on that machine or on its router.
- Players do not need port forwarding.
- Self-test: `python tools/net/test_ssbu_lobby.py`
- On a Linux server (for example an Oracle Cloud Always Free Ubuntu VM): copy `tools/net/ssbu_lobby.py` and
  `tools/net/deploy_lobby.sh` to it and run `sudo bash deploy_lobby.sh [port]`. It installs a systemd service and opens
  the VM's firewall; open the same UDP port in the cloud's own firewall (Oracle: VCN Security List ingress rule).
- Matchmaking needs lobby 1.3 or newer, the rollback "finding an opponent" of Smash (versus) lobby 1.4 or newer (`curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/status` on the server shows the version).
- Update a running server: copy the new `tools/net/ssbu_lobby.py` next to `deploy_lobby.sh` and run
  `sudo bash deploy_lobby.sh [port]` again (add `DOMAIN=...` if you used it), or just
  `sudo install -m 644 ssbu_lobby.py /opt/ssbu-lobby/ && sudo systemctl restart ssbu-lobby`. Players reconnect by themselves.

### 4. Auto

- `SSBU_ONLINE=1`, or `online_mode = auto`.
- If `online_server` is set, it uses the lobby. After 5 seconds without an answer, it falls back to LAN.
- If `online_server` is not set, it uses LAN.

## Other settings

- `online_name` / `SSBU_ONLINE_NAME`: your name in the lobby log.
- `online_code` / `SSBU_ONLINE_CODE`: lobby code. Default: `public`.
- `online_direct = off` / `SSBU_ONLINE_DIRECT=0`: no direct connections (see way 3).
- `online_stun`: STUN server used to find your public address. Default `stun.l.google.com:19302`. Set `off` to disable.
- `SSBU_ONLINE_PORT` / `online_local_port`: local UDP port (default: any). A fixed one lets a firewall that drops UDP
  nobody asked for be opened for direct paths, e.g. on Linux with ufw: `online_local_port = 39510` and
  `sudo ufw allow 39510/udp`. If the port is taken (a second copy of the game), any free port is used instead.
- `SSBU_ONLINE_LOG=0..3`: log level. Default 1.

## Requirements

- Both players need the same game update (13.0.4 or 13.0.5) and the same mods. The game version and a hash of the
  loaded mods are part of the build id (e.g. `ssbu-recomp-ldn1-13.0.5`, or `ssbu-recomp-ldn1-13.0.5+m1a2b3c4d` with
  mods), shown in the log lines `[online] on` and `[online] mods`.
- Rooms of another version or another mod set are still listed (in the game's Rooms List and in F1 -> Online),
  but they cannot be joined: trying shows a box with the reason, for example
  "Different version: this room is 13.0.4, you have 13.0.5" or "MISSING: <mod names>".
- For lobby and LAN, the lobby code must match.

## Online rooms (F1)

F1 -> **Online** also lists every room of your lobby: host, game version, mods, players, and whether you can join.
Select a row to see why a room cannot be joined. Joining itself is done in the game: Local Wireless -> Rooms List.

Mods counted: the sub-folders of the characters folder (`SSBU_CHARACTERS`, a fighter's `fighter.json` name or the
folder name) and the DLLs of `SSBU_MODS`. Two copies of a mod match when their files have the same names and sizes.
`online_list_other = off` in `config\graphics.ini` keeps rooms of other builds out of the game's own list (they stay in F1).

An older lobby server lists only rooms of your own build (F1 says so); an older game keeps working as before and only
sees rooms of its own build.

## Status and limits

- Experimental.
- Tested with two game instances on one PC: lobby, LAN and host/join modes. Full matches ran with both players' inputs, and the fighters' states were identical frame by frame on both sides.
- NOT yet tested between two PCs, over the internet, against a real UPnP router, or with STUN.
- No encryption and no authentication. Play only with people you know.
- By default it uses the game's own delay-based netcode. **Rollback netcode** (experimental) is an option, see below.
- For now the room code is shown only in the log, on lines starting with `[online]`.
- On first start, Windows may ask to allow the game through the firewall. LAN and host modes need it.

## Rollback netcode (experimental)

Smooth fights at high ping: each game runs the match locally and only the players' inputs travel; a late input rolls the
game back a few frames and replays them, instead of slowing both players down.

1. **Switch it on:** in the game, **F1 -> Experimental -> Rollback netcode: ON**, then restart the game (Play SSBU.bat).
   Nothing extra to build: rollback runs on the normal game build (the game saves the fight by learning, at the start of
   each fight, which memory it writes). An older install's second copy for rollback (`ssbu_game_r1.dll`,
   `ssbu_native_rb.exe`, the folder `nro_bin_eh_o2r1`) is not used any more and can be deleted.
2. **Both players** need it on, the same game update (13.0.4 or 13.0.5) and the same version of this project.
3. **Smash (versus) stays local:** without a room code a Smash fight is a normal local fight (friends, CPUs), rollback
   on or not. Finding an opponent will come with the game's own Online menu (Quickplay), in progress.
4. **With a room code** (section 2 above): one player uses `online_mode = host` and gives the code, the other
   `online_mode = join` with that code; both open Smash (versus): the code connects the two (while a code is set, Smash fights are online).

**Local Wireless rooms use rollback** when the room has exactly 2 players and both have rollback on: the room's match
(started by the room maker) is played with rollback; the room maker is player 1. The fighters, colours, stage and rules are
the room's. Each player plays with his own name-tag controls (button layout and options), sent to the other game. The room's waiting stage, rooms with more than 2 players, and a room where one player has rollback
off use the game's own online netcode as before (a short message says so once), so players with different settings can
still play together in a room.

Input delay is chosen from the best measured round trip: 1 frame below about 117 ms, 2 frames from about 117 ms, 3 from 150 ms,
4 from about 184 ms (the rest of the trip is covered by rollback).

Limits today: rollbacks of 3 or more frames take a little longer than one frame (a short hitch at very high ping);
Windows only; tested between two games on one PC with simulated 150 ms ping and loss (0 desyncs), not yet much between
real players over the internet. Please report how it feels.
