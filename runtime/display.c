 * (0x710593a440) by the number of refreshes counted since the previous present. So the refresh count IS the game's

 * clock that restarted its phase after every late frame: between two presents the game counted 0, 1 or 2 refreshes,
 * and "0" counts as one step while "2" counts as two, so the match clock gained (10.77 s per 600 frames).
 * Now: refresh n happens at t0 + n/60 s; at each one the vsync event is signalled and then the frames waiting to be
 * shown are released. A frame queued between refresh n and n+1 is shown at n+1, and no sooner than `interval`
 * refreshes after the frame before it (nvnWindowSetPresentInterval); the game is held in its wait for the window
 * texture (nvnSyncWait on the sync of nvnWindowAcquireTexture), which is AFTER it has read the refresh count, as on

/* ---- Track V session 14: frame pacing against the DISPLAY.
 * (1) The display's vertical blanks are timed on a thread of their own (D3DKMTWaitForVerticalBlankEvent on the output of
 *     the monitor the window is on: the kernel's own vblank interrupt, no swapchain involved): refresh period, a count.
 * (2) PRESENT AT THE TICK: the frame the game finished is handed to the window at the next tick of the refresh clock
 *     (display_present_plan on the game's thread decides the tick, display_hold_present on the render thread waits for
 *     it just before vkQueuePresentKHR), not "tick + the time the frame took". A frame that is LATE (queued after the
 *     tick it was due at) is presented at once, as before. The game is released at the same tick as before: its own
 *     timing does not change. SSBU_PACE_HOLD=0: presents as before (when ready).
 * (3) DISPLAY LOCK (vsync = display | auto in graphics.ini, SSBU_PACE=display|clock): when the measured refresh rate is
 *     within 1.1 % of k x 60 Hz (60, 119.88, 120, 240 ...), the tick is every k-th vblank + half a refresh (the present
 *     then lands in the middle between two vblanks: as far from the compositor's latch as it can be), so every game
 *     frame is on screen for exactly k refreshes. The game then runs at refresh / k frames per second (59.94 on a
 *     119.88 Hz panel: 0.1 % slow). Any other panel (75, 100, 144, 165 Hz): our own 60.000 Hz clock, presents at the tick.
 * (4) What the screen got: for every present, the vblank that follows it; a frame's time on screen = the vblanks between
 *     its present and the next frame's (0 = replaced before it was shown). Histogram in the report and per 600 frames
 *     with SSBU_PACESTAT=1. This is the compositor model "the last picture presented before a vblank is what the next
 *     refresh shows" on MEASURED vblank times; it is not a camera. */

/* ---- Track L1 (input latency), 2026-10-14.
 * (1) SSBU_L1=1, TEST ONLY: per presented game frame, on the host's clock: the game's release from its wait for the window
 *     texture (display_wait_refresh), player 1's pad poll (nnhid.c), the present call (display_present_plan), the frame
 *     READY on the render thread (recorded and submitted: display_present_defer), vkQueuePresentKHR (display_present_done)
 *     and the display's vblank that follows it (the "shown" model of session 14: the first refresh that can show it).
 *     Percentiles over fight frames at exit (`l1-stage:` lines); `l1-press:` / `l1-after:` lines for every new press of
 *     player 1 in a fight (the injected press of the sequence) with the next presents.
 * (2) latency = normal | low | lowest (graphics.ini; SSBU_LATENCY=0|1|2 or the names wins):
 *     low: the game is released from its wait LATER than the tick, by D = tick period - (largest release-to-ready time of
 *          the last 64 frames + margin), so that it reads the pad as late as the frame can still be ready for the next
 *          tick; the present stays at the tick (display lock and cadence unchanged). The refresh count the game reads is
 *          the same (the tick was given; only the moment the game goes on moves), so its logic steps do not change.
 *          A late frame that had been delayed sets D to 0 for 60 frames (one late without a delay is not ours). SSBU_LATENCY_MARGIN=<ms> (default 2.0).
 *     lowest: low + the frame is presented as soon as it is ready (no hold for the tick, as vsync = off does). */
